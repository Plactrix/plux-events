About:
  I got a little bored so I decided to create a script that can be used for server event nights. This script is basically a merged resource from resources but modified by me a bit. As of right now, there are only a couple implmented events, however, there will be LOTs more coming soon!

Currently Implemented Events:
  - The Purge
  - Earth Quake

Installation Instructions:
1. Upload the resource to your FXServer and move it to the resources folder
2. Configure the resource to your liking in the config.lua
3. Add "start plux-events" to your server.cfg

How-to:
    Simply give yourself the permission that was set in the config, then type "/event [eventname]" (read the chat suggestion for available events).

Support:
    If you have any issues, questions, or need help setting up the script, join our Discord server and open a support ticket.
